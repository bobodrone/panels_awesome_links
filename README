This patch provides you with a number of really helpful links that showup in the popup links in each pane:

Now you can directly from each pane edit (in a new window) your

* views
* view panes
* blocks
* menus
* taxonomi page
* site information
* node content pages
* cck fields

It is very useful for views for example since it is sometimes very hard to know which view that pane contains.

Have fun!
